# Flutter web docker template

Followed this tutorial from Codemagic: https://blog.codemagic.io/how-to-dockerize-flutter-apps/,
and set up web support following Flutter docs: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web

Created a new project `Demo` inside workspace folder. To start server, enter the folder (`demo`) and run `flutter run`.
